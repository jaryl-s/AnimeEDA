# Analysis of Popular Japanese Anime Genres in Python

This project is a two-part analysis of popular Japanese anime genres in Python. 

In the first part of this study, exploratory data analysis was performed on a CSV file from Kaggle containing over 12,000 anime series. Subsequently, a graphical 
analysis of the rating distribution, type distribution, as well as genre distribution was conducted using several relevant libraries and functions. From an inspection 
of the dataset, the most commonly-produced genres of anime by the industry can be shown. 

In the second part, web scraping was conducted to extract sentiment data from selected subreddit threads discussing recommended anime titles. Data visualisation was 
then executed to identify the most positively-viewed genres of anime by a sample of the Reddit community.
